<b>OrangApps</b> is a young, fresh and dynamic start-up company founded by <b>Gian Scottie Javelona</b>, a 19 year-old college student from <i>Polytechnic University of the Philippines</i> along with his co-founder, 18 year-old <b>Paulo Benologa.</b> 

We started creating software application programs as a game to challenge ourselves if we could develop efficient and effective solutions and find ways to do things at a speed we never thought possible. That challenge gave birth to our company.

Our internship at <i>Smart Communications</i> led us to create a software program for them and now with our own company, we are beginning to create mobile apps that appeal to the android mobile users. 

At OrangeApps, our focus is to create new ideas and come up with innovative and relevant information technology products. We aim to build products and services that can be deeply integrated with every device people want to use.

Our brainchild, <i>The Pup Mobile Portal</i> is a gateway for online content application for Android mobile devices that caters to the students, faculty, alumni and guest of Polytechnic University of the Philippines.
